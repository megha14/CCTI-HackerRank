# Is given tree a Binary Search Tree

For the purposes of this challenge, we define a binary search tree to be a binary tree with the following ordering properties:

The data value of every node in a node's left subtree is less than the data value of that node.
The data value of every node in a node's right subtree is greater than the data value of that node.
Given the root node of a binary tree, can you determine if it's also a binary search tree?
